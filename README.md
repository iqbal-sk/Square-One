Square One: Deep Learning Foundations

In the fast-moving world of AI, there is constant pressure to catch up with the latest hype—Agents, LLMs, and Generative pipelines. In the rush to apply these tools, we often gloss over the fundamental concepts that makes them work.

"Back to Square One" is my personal initiative to revisit Deep Learning foundations. This repository is not about blindly following tutorials; it is about first-principles experimentation. My goal is to re-implement, stress-test, and mathematically verify standard techniques to understand why they work, rather than just accepting.
